# Sentiment-Analysis
This project utilizes natural language processing techniques to develop a sentiment analysis model, enabling the classification of text data as positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing linguistic features and patterns, the model determines the emotional tone and opinion orientation of text inputs, providing valuable insights for various applications, such as customer feedback analysis, political opinion polling, and social media monitoring. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment analysis, enabling businesses and organizations to make informed decisions based on public opinions and sentiment trends.
